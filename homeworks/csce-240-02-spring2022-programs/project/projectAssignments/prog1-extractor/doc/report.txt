I am confused with what is expected from this project. At first I thought we would be using some sort of program 
that scans the website for information to fill our chatbot with but from talking with my peers, it appears not to be the case.
Instead, I copied the information from the website directly and pasted it into a text file. From there, I managed to read 
in the information into an output file. From the instructions given, it seems like all we had to do was read in the information, 
report statistics, and then write the content back out which I did. I am looking forward to more instruction on how to proceed
and I am more than willing to change my program to adhere to more specifications.
