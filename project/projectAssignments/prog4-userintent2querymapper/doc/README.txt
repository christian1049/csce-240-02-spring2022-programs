The program should run as expected. I think the code I have written is good and functional but the only thing I have doubts about
is how to make my code more concise. I also would like to learn how to split my code into different methods but 
it seems like that would be very hard to do at times. I feel like if I had someone to guide me it would make it 
much easier. 

I split the user input into words and check each word throughout the chatbot's keyword queries. I used a counter to check how
many matches there were. I then used a function that finds the max counter. I finally used an if statement that checked
if there were matches for 70% or more of the user input.
